# CSE140
This course covers basic concepts and recent developments of computerarchitecture, using the MIPS process as a primary example.

## Project 1
In this project, you will create an instruction interpreter for a subset of MIPS code. Starting with the assembled instructions in memory, you will fetch, disassemble, decode, and execute MIPS machine instructions, simulating each stage in the computation. You're creating what is effectively a miniature version of MARS! There is one important difference, thoughâ€”MARS takes in assembly language source Hiles, not .dump Hiles, so it contains an assembler, too.
